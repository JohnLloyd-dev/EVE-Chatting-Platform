# VPS Deployment Commands

## Summary

The AI response control feature has been successfully implemented and pushed to the repository. Here are the commands to deploy it on your VPS:

## Commands to Run on VPS

### 1. Navigate to project directory and pull changes

```bash
cd /path/to/your/eve/project
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Run the database migration

```bash
# Option A: Using the Python migration script (recommended)
docker compose exec backend python run_migration.py

# Option B: Using direct SQL (if Option A doesn't work)
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d chatting_platform -c "
DO \$\$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT column_name
        FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = 'users'
        AND column_name = 'ai_responses_enabled'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN ai_responses_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
        UPDATE users SET ai_responses_enabled = TRUE WHERE ai_responses_enabled IS NULL;
        RAISE NOTICE 'Successfully added ai_responses_enabled column to users table';
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'Column ai_responses_enabled already exists in users table';
    END IF;
END \$\$;
"

# Option C: Simple SQL command (if the above doesn't work)
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d chatting_platform -c "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ai_responses_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;"
```

### 3. Restart the services

```bash
docker compose restart backend celery-worker frontend
```

### 4. Verify deployment

```bash
# Check if services are running
docker compose ps

# Check backend logs
docker compose logs backend

# Check if the new API endpoint is working
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/health
```

## What's New

### Admin Interface

- New "Enable AI" / "Disable AI" button next to the "Block User" button
- "AI Disabled" badge in the conversation list for users with disabled AI
- Separate control for AI responses vs user blocking

### Backend Changes

- New API endpoint: `POST /admin/toggle-ai-responses`
- AI model no longer receives admin messages in conversation context
- Users with disabled AI won't get AI responses but can still send messages

### Testing

1. Go to admin panel â†’ Conversations
2. Select a conversation
3. You should see both "Block User" and "Enable/Disable AI" buttons
4. Test toggling AI responses
5. Send admin messages and verify they don't appear in AI context

## Troubleshooting

If migration fails:

```bash
# Check database connection
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d chatting_platform -c "SELECT version();"

# Manual column addition if needed
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d chatting_platform -c "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN ai_responses_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;"
```

If services don't start:

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs celery-worker
docker compose logs frontend

# Rebuild if needed
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```
